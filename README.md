## Features

1. **Disease Search**  
   - Users input symptoms in natural language and receive relevant drug recommendations.  
   - Outputs additional drug-related details from the `madeby_me.csv` dataset.  

2. **Dosage Safety Check**  
   - Users provide a generic drug name and dosage to check safety guidelines.  
   - Outputs data from the `dosageByme.csv` dataset, including slug and additional safety instructions.  

3. **Pregnancy Safety**  
   - Provides pregnancy-related safety recommendations for drugs.  
   - Retrieves information from the `pregnantByme.csv` dataset.  

4. **Mini Doctor Interaction**  
   - Simulates intelligent conversations for medical advice.  
   - Trained on a doctor-patient interaction dataset to provide personalized and context-aware responses.
